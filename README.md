# Hypercerts template repository

Welcome to the Hypercerts Template! This is a simple template for creating a fundraising platform based on hypercerts.

## Features

### For builders

- Mint hypercerts with custom metadata
- Provide a simple interface for evaluating hypercerts
- Use custom frontend components for context specific data, like rendering GPS data based on the geoJSON format.

### For operators

- Contain the UX to your specific use case
- Expose domain specific data like GPS coordinates, measurements, etc.
- Design custom fund raising experiences

## Helpful References

- [Hypercerts Documentation](https://hypercerts.org/docs/) Hypercerts create this interoperability by serving as a single, open, shared, decentralized database for impact funding mechanisms. A single hypercert is a semi-fungible token that accounts for work that is supposed to be impactful and whose ownership is fractionizable and transferable (under specific conditions). Hypercerts do not impose any specific funding mechanisms but provide baseline invariant guarantees such that claims will not be forgotten as different mechanisms come into and out of fashion. This is also why hypercerts are especially useful for any retrospective funding mechanisms â€“ funding can be applied to claims of the past.
